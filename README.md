The Kaleidowave

I wanted to create a piece that was visually captivating and provided the user with a unique experience.

The Kaleidowave uses animated 2D objects to create a 3D effect using a mesh of horizontal and vertical lines.

By moving the mouse around the screen the user creates mapping values which are used by the code to create waves.

I created this work to symbolise how perception can be altered. The circular motion makes the particles appear to move on all of the planes. This creates the 3D effect as if you are looking at the sea from a birds eye view.

Adding the buttons was a nice touch and allowed the user to change the colour to either a random colour in the spectrum or pure red, green, or blue. To make the buttons I used the button function that is part of the p5 library.
