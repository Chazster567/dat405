The Kaleidowave

I wanted to create a piece that was visually captivating and provided the user with a unique experience.

The Kaleidowave uses animated 2D objects to create a 3D effect using a mesh of horizontal and vertical lines.

By moving the mouse around the screen the user creates mapping values which are used by the code to create waves.

I created this work to symbolise how perception can be altered. The circular motion makes the particles appear to move on all of the planes. This creates the 3D effect as if you are looking at the sea from a birds eye view.

Adding the buttons was a nice touch and allowed the user to change the colour to either a random colour in the spectrum or pure red, green, or blue. To make the buttons I used the button function that is part of the p5 library.

The waves are made using the movement variables. The movement is created by the x and y values being increased whilst also being multiplied by the sin or cos of the angle. The angle is produced using the mouse maps and canvas properties.

I'm satisfied with the way this has turned out. The possibilities and outcomes with the colour changes and mouse movement are very diverse and unique which means you can experiment with it for a long time before it becomes repetitive.
